  talk-title: What's that supposed to mean?
  talk-description: |
    Have you ever cursed at the symbols on a washing machine, puzzled at the
    pictorial navigation of a website, or panicked at that inscrutable symbol on
    the car dashboard that's flashing red? I have. Especially the last one. (I
    eventually discovered that I'd been driving with the parking brake on.)

    All this has happened before, and all this will happen again. (Except for me
    driving with the parking brake on.) Throughout history, humanity has faced
    the challenge of putting complex and abstract concepts onto paper or clay or
    rock or skin or whatever. It usually starts out in the same way, but the end
    results have been very varied: We've ended up with alphabets, abjads,
    abugidas, logograms and syllabaries.  Oh, and the symbols on modern
    industrial devices.

    I'll describe the history of some of the more interesting writing systems
    and explain how Chinese works, that Japanese can be really hard, and why you
    should be really glad you're not an Akkadian. I hope that it will be
    enlightening and fascinating, but I also hope that it will help to inform
    the way that people approach pictorial communication in the future. I also
    hope that it will go some way towards explaining why there are so many
    hamburger menus, and inspire people to do better.

  talk-title: He Doesn't Work Here Anymore
  talk-description: |
    What happens when a highly visible and successful developer announces to
    the world that they plan to transition from male to female?

    In August of 2013 I stood with friends on the stage at a Ruby conference and
    told the world that I am transgender. I began the long process of my
    personal, social, professional, and physical transition from male to female.

    I would like to share the lessons I'm learning, the perspective I'm gaining,
    and the inspiration I'm finding through the experience of living and working
    in two genders. How is this change impacting my career as a developer?
    Interactions with my peers? My relationship with the development community?
    Is it influencing how I create and appreciate code? My hope is to spark
    conversations and create opportunities for shared learning and growth by
    exploring the intersection of gender and technology.

  talk-title: Computer Art at Bell Labs
  talk-description: |
    During the 1960's, computer scientists at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ
    explored the limits of computers through art and music. Some worked by
    themselves to discover push the boundaries of computer animation, others
    brought in visual artists and composers to collaborate on art experiements
    on Bell Lab's equipment after the work day.

    In this talk, I'll talk about some of the experiments of computer scientists
    and artists during this time. We'll look at their influence on how we use
    computers today, and why we should embrace the spirit of experimentation and
    collaboration.

  talk-title: Ruby Monsters Go Bump In The Night
  talk-description: |
    An exploration of the forgotten and dusty corners of Ruby, including a tour
    of some very unusual behaviors from threads, loops, exceptions and procs.
    This is a technical deep dive into some obscure features of Ruby that may
    someday crawl out from under your bed, and when they do you'll be glad you
    were prepared for the fight.

    Jeremy’s been programming about half as long as he’s been alive. He gets all
    weird if he thinks about it too much. Jeremy lives in Seattle and helps kids
    learn math with the brilliant team at Think Through Math. An eternal
    optimist and gabby extrovert, Jeremy will talk about most anything, but
    really gets going when topics turn to vinyl and audio, coffee roasting,
    board games, tattoos, or cooking. His best friend is a chihuahua, but don't
    tell his cat. Say hello at [@_jnf](https://twitter.com/_jnf).

    Carol is currently the Hammer of Justice at Think Through Math in the lovely
    Pittsburgh, PA. MOVE TO PITTSBURGH IT’S AWESOME! She loves hugs and getting
    people together to do awesome things like putting on Steel City Ruby Conf.
    GIVE HER A HUG! Her co-speaker Jeremy has recently gotten her into vinyl.
    WATCH HER WALLET GET SMALLER! She has a cat whose name is Frances but
    everyone calls her Baby. NO ONE PUTS BABY IN A CORNER! Her twitter handle is
    [@carols10cents](https://twitter.com/carols10cents) and there are TWO jokes
    contained within its depths. TWEET HUGS!

  talk-title: 'Ten Years of Ruby Conferences: A Dramatic Revue'
  talk-description:
    Many incredible people have given many amazing talks at Ruby or Rails
    conferences over the years, and we’d like to take a look back at some of
    the best. From _why the Lucky Stiff to Sandi Metz, from Matz to DHH, from
    Tenderlove to Jim Weirich, we will be giving you a whirlwind tour through
    the conference ages. You’ll learn where those important ideas you take for
    granted got their start. You’ll laugh and you’ll cry as you experience how
    the Ruby Community has grown over the years and how we’ve connected through
    our shared conference experiences. Rain ponchos recommended for the front
    row. This talk features creations by Brenna Flood.

  talk-title: How To Code Like a Writer
  talk-description: |
    As developers, we spend more of our time writing than we do thinking about
    the nuances of computer science. What would happen if we approached code
    like a writing exercise instead of a technical pursuit? What if we applied
    patterns from elegant prose instead of Gang of Four? Let's try it!

    We'll take some smelly Ruby and refactor it using only advice from Strunk
    and White's "The Elements of Style", the canonical text on writing
    beautiful, understandable English. You'll come away with a new approach to
    your craft and a new appreciation of the similarities between great writing
    and great code.
